Interactive Quiz Application 🧠🎯

This is a simple and interactive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users can answer multiple-choice questions, and at the end, the quiz calculates the total score and displays the result based on the user's performance.

This project helped me practice important JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic updates, and conditional rendering based on user interaction.

The UI is clean, fully responsive, and designed for a smooth user experience.
